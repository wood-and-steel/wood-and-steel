### Overview
Add support for multiple simultaneous games in progress, allowing players to switch between them using unique four-letter codes.

### Requirements
- Support multiple games in progress at the same time
- Only one game needs to be actively playable at any given moment
- When a new game is started, assign it a unique four-letter code
- The four-letter code is **case-insensitive** (e.g., "aBcD" is the same as "ABCD")
- Display the assigned code to the player on the game interface
- Players can switch between active games by:
  - Selecting a "switch game" command/option
  - Providing the four-letter code of an existing game in progress
- Provide a way to view a list of all games in progress
- Players can delete a game in progress by:
  - Selecting a "delete game" command/option
  - Providing the four-letter code of the game to delete
- Games persist indefinitely (no time limit or automatic cleanup)

### Suggested Implementation Approach

**1. Game Storage & Management**
- Create a game manager/registry to track multiple game instances
- Store games in a map/dictionary with their four-letter codes as keys (normalized to uppercase or lowercase for case-insensitive comparison)
- Each game instance should maintain its own state independently

**2. Code Generation**
- Implement a code generator that creates unique, random four-letter codes
- Normalize codes for comparison (convert to uppercase/lowercase) to ensure case-insensitivity
- Ensure uniqueness by checking against existing active games
- Character set: A-Z (26^4 = ~456K possible combinations)

**3. UI/UX Changes**
- Display the current game's four-letter code in the game interface
- Add a "Switch Game" button/menu option with input field for entering code
- Add a "Delete Game" button/menu option with input field for entering code
- Add a "View Games" option to display a list of all games in progress with their codes

**4. State Management**
- Implement logic to "pause" the current game when switching
- Load and "resume" the selected game's state
- Ensure game states are persisted (localStorage, database, etc.)
- Handle game deletion by removing the game state from storage

**5. Validation & Error Handling**
- Validate code format (exactly 4 letters, case-insensitive)
- Handle invalid codes with appropriate error messages
- Confirm before deleting a game to prevent accidental deletion

### Open Questions
- Should there be a limit on the number of concurrent games per player?
